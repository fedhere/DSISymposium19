Cataract was the most prevalent cause of human blindness until the development of surgical therapies.  However, not all cells can be removed, and these undergo a wound healing response leading to the deposition of a mixture of opaque scar tissue and dysgenic lens fiber cells in the visual axis. The resulting visual loss is defined as posterior capsular opacification (PCO), the major complication of cataract surgery, while other complications may also occur including  glaucoma and the exacerbation of macular degeneration.   However, the population wide risks of cataract surgery are unknown, a gap that has the potential to be filled by using Medicare data to determine the age stratified rates of cataract surgery and its acute post-surgical side effects, the age dependent risk of developing posterior capsular opacification, and the risk of developing vision-compromising sequelae.

We fit Generalized Linear Mixed Models by season for each of the five quantiles of bird flight altitude. We found that birds generally fly higher over urban areas compared to rural areas in spring, and marginally higher at the mid‐layers of the vertical distribution in autumn.

Large-scale land acquisitions (LSLAs) by multinational investors have emerged as an important mechanism linking the demands of distant actors to forests in the Global South. Yet it remains unclear if LSLAs have preferentially targeted forested areas or influenced rates of forest loss. We perform a global assessment of the effects of LSLAs on forests by combining georeferenced maps of individual land deals with satellite data on annual forest cover. We find that LSLAs were granted in areas of higher forest cover in 81% of cases and enhanced forest loss in 45% of cases. We observe no significant influence in all other instances.

Recent reviews have highlighted the potential of multiple forms of statistical learning research (i.e., machine learning, deep learning, ensemble learning) for better understanding soil distribution in space and time, and for enabling the monitoring of soil condition using digital soil mapping (DSM) across scales. We use a data-driven DSM conceptual framework as an example to demonstrate the potential of statistical learning for the optimal production of digital soil maps. From the plot to the continental scale, we present a state of the art review on statistical learning and show multiple real case prediction problems on DSM. We compare and test multiple forms of statistical learning and identify why different statistical learning methods generate different results (e.g., under which level of data availability, scale and type of spatial configuration). We provide recommendations through open source code and data sharing principles for ensuring reproducible results.

Whereas inteins were previously thought to be parasitic genetic elements providing no benefit to the host organism, recent studies suggest that inteins may impact host ecology, providing a selective advantage to the organism in which they reside by exhibiting post-translational control on extein sequences. Additionally, this ability to post-translationally control other proteins has been leveraged in various biotech and genetic engineering applications. Given their utility, inteins have been the subject of an increasing number of studies aiming to identify novel inteins in large protein datasets.

In 1961 Jean Gottman published Megalopolis (Gottmann 1961), a treatise on the densely populated counties between Boston MA and Washington DC on the eastern coast of North America. The book included a chapter on Megalopolitan forests describing their past, present, and future prospects. Almost 60 years have passed since Megalopolis was published, and the trend toward reforestation has reversed as urban centers have gained favor with the generations following the post-WWII “Baby Boomers”. We present our analysis of modern Megalopolitan temperate deciduous forests of 1 ha and larger: there are currently approximately 250,0000.

Based on the proposed probabilistic representation, we propose a novel regularization learning algorithm for DNNs, which independently learns these prior distributions from the training dataset, thereby generating precise regularizations and preventing DNNs from overfitting.

Warm deep ocean waters move heat towards glaciers that extend deep into the water. These glaciers are melted by and thus add fresher waters into the oceans. The melt raises sea level and drives a more intense ocean circulation. Time scales range from hours to millennia as tides, weather, and orbital cycles all change rates of mass and heat exchanges.

New sensor technologies, platforms, and modeling applied to Greenland all generate data that overwhelms most investigators: several ships operate around Greenland every year while satellites sense surface features at 15 meter scales every day.

Two diseases sharing common genes tend to increase their comorbidity. We formulate the search for missing common genes as an optimization problem to minimize network based module separation from two subgraphs produced by mapping genes associated with disease onto the interactome. To predict whether two diseases are comorbid, we embed the interactome into a high dimensional geometric space with weights assigned to the network edges and uses the projection onto different dimension to “fingerprint” disease modules to discriminate comorbid diseases versus non-comorbid diseases. Remarkable performance is reported when the methods are tested in cross-validation with a benchmark dataset of more than 600 disease pairs.

UV resonance lines reveal clues about the density and velocity structure of the magnetosphere, and help us study the wind/field interaction.

Abstract: Monitoring the monsoon crops through optical satellite data in tropical regions is challenging due to many reasons including consistent cloud cover throughout the season, small field size, and highly dynamic cropping pattern through space and time. Radar data provide an alternative for monsoon crop mapping and monitoring due to the sensor’s cloud penetrating capabilities. In this work, a machine-learning based random forest (RF) classifier was applied for monsoon crop monitoring in India. We processed 420 scenes of dual polarization (VH+VV) Sentinel-1 radar data on Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. For validation of the proposed method, stratified random samples were collected in a contiguous region composed of eight different agro-ecological regions in India.

While there has been extensive national research on the impact of tobacco marketing and likelihood of future tobacco use, there is a need for more research at a level local to Delaware. The goal of this research project is to look for correlations between locations of POS tobacco advertising, use of tobacco products, and assessment of overall health. The first step was to create a map identifying all locations where business retailers are licensed to sell tobacco within the city of Wilmington. The next step was to collect images of tobacco advertising and overlay that data on the locations of all licensed tobacco retailers. The future aim of the study is to determine how the exposure to POS tobacco advertising impacts public health trends of community members in Wilmington.",,Public Policy& Administration   (CAS) (Biden school),Dr. Federica Bianco and Dr. Gregory Dobler,,,

Yet, tracking their diversity is difficult due to a lack of marker gene in phages like 16S genes in prokaryotes. Similarly, difficulty in isolating and culturing viruses have made their phenotypic studies difficult. More than 25% of dsDNA viruses are shown to have DNA polymerase genes. Given the important role of DNA polymerase enzymes in viral replication, identifying viral DNA polymerase genes and their signature patterns will help us know more about their diversity as well as phenotypic featues. In the following study, viral DNA polymerase sequences from two viral metagenome datasets, GOV and SERC are mined. We have tried to identify differential residues and patterns at equivalent positions between viral and bacterial polymerases, and also among viruses. We aim to identify links between the patterns and phenotypic differences between viruses and bacteria as well as within viruses.  ",,Agriculture and Natural Resources   (CANR),Shawn Polson,,,

For each user in a social network, improving the diversity of friendship network can not only entrench diversified information channels but also enhance his/her social capital. Diverging from diversification methods in recommender systems, which try to improve the diversity while maintaining precision at an acceptable level, we define diversity preference to portray individual's demand of friend diversity and formulate a new research problem: diversity preference-aware link recommendation problem. We model the problem as a sum-of-ratio optimization programming to select recommendations from a candidate set by maximizing the diversity preference matching score.

Here, we present a protein sidechain refinement method based on CryoEM densities with near-atomic resolutions. This method uses the protein structures as inputs. Followed by structure analyses based on Molprobity, the problematic residues in the input structures were identified and refined in the real-space. The refined structures created could be used as initial models for the next refinement. We applied this method to 20 protein structures in PDB. The results suggest that the overall Molprobity scores of the models are notably improved and most of the structural defects in the initial models are fixed.

This is why planners produce renderings, maps, and other visualizations when they ask the public to think of planning related changes to the spaces around them. What if we could do better? If space indeed is the planner’s laboratory, then, instead of simulated changes, could planners actually experiment in the field? Could national models like “better block” and other tactical urbanism projects be used to allow the public to experience changes to the built environment in an immersive sense? And what if we could capture peoples’ interaction with the built environment on camera?
I propose to present findings and ideas from a Better Block project that I implemented in Wilmington DE in 2014 together with West Side Grows Together, a coalition of residents, businesses, and community organizations in the west side of Wilmington. This project presents opportunities for a discussion of all of the above-mentioned ideas.

Data technologies will empower citizens to indicate their service preferences in real-time and allow governments to tailor service delivery to both community and individual needs. In the process, public services can be provided more effectively and economically. The automation of routine activities can save billions of dollars through increased efficiencies and cost reductions. New jobs will be created and many current jobs eliminated.
This, in turn, will affect how and for what jobs public servants are trained. The unfolding revolution in governance has major implications for equity and ethics in the delivery of public services, which will be addressed including a discussion of moral and social justice issues surrounding projected disparities, data biases, and accountability for automated decision making.",,,,,
